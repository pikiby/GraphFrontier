- Clear force multiplier under cursor (GraphFrontier)
- Align pins to grid (GraphFrontier)
- Pin node under cursor (GraphFrontier)

- Unpin node under cursor (GraphFrontier)
- Pin linked to orbit under cursor (GraphFrontier)
- Unpin linked nodes under cursor (GraphFrontier)
- Add to search under cursor (GraphFrontier)

## Practical Notes

- Commands with `under cursor` require:
  - active GraphFrontier view
  - a node under mouse cursor
- If no active GraphFrontier view exists, command shows a notice.
- Hotkeys work best when focus is not inside a text input.

## Suggested Starter Mapping

- `Open GraphFrontier`: quick global shortcut
- `Add to search under cursor`: fast graph exploration
- `Strong pull under cursor` / `Clear strong pull under cursor`: fast local force tuning
- `Pin node under cursor` / `Unpin node under cursor`: layout locking workflow
